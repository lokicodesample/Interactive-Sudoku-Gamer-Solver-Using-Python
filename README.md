Statement of the Problem: 
The task is to solve a given 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. 
A Sudoku puzzle is a partially filled 9x9 grid where the goal is to assign digits 
(from 1 to 9) to the empty cells in such a way that every row, every column, and 
every 3x3 subgrid contains each digit exactly once. The solution must ensure 
that the puzzle remains valid at each step. 
Additionally, the program should have two modes: 
• Mode 1: The program generates a Sudoku puzzle (easy, medium, or hard) 
and allows the user to solve it. 
• Mode 2: The user inputs a Sudoku puzzle, and the program checks 
whether a solution exists.
